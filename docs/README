SUMMARY

Musica
by Dustin Kirkland <dustin.kirkland@gmail.com>

Musica is a web application for browsing and listening to your music.
Songs are organized hierarchically in folders of Artists, and sub-folders
of Albums. The PHP script presents an interface for navigating among
artists and albums. It dynamically generates playlists, allows for
downloading single songs, entire albums, and links to Wikipedia articles
on artists and albums.


RELEASE NOTES

/var/lib/musica/music should be a symbolic link to a folder containing
your music.

The music directory should contain one directory per artist.

Each artist directory should contain one directory per album, and optionally
miscellaneous songs (mp3's and/or ogg's) by that artist.

Each album directory should contain songs (mp3's and/or ogg's).

Musica uses this rigid directory structure such that it does not require
a relational database.

Musica uses the Silk Icon Set under the CCA2.5 license, and are available at:
